The LE3D renderer uses CMake to prepare the build environment to compile
the example projects. The first step is to download and install CMake and
generate the required Makefiles or build projects.

A) For Linux / Unix users
=========================

Packages needed:
================
gcc
g++
libc6
libc6-dev
linux-libc-dev
xorg-dev

Run CMake to generate a Makefile.
Run make.

B) For MacOS users
=========================

Packages needed:
================

C) For Windows users
=========================

The LE3D codebase has been tested and compiles successfully with mingw32,
mingw64 and MS Visual Studio C++ compilers.

Run CMake to generate either:
- a Makefile
- a Visual Studio
- a Codeblocks project.

Compile the examples with your favorite compiler.
